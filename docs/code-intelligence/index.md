# F13 — MCP and code intelligence

Primary phase: IP07. Target: Authorize actual MCP dispatch; qualify guest ripgrep, Tree-sitter and LSP using pinned artifacts.

Dependencies and consumers: [tools](../tools/index.md), [workspace](../workspace/index.md). These are responsibility links, not whole-feature build ordering; see the [roadmap](../engineering/roadmap.md).

- [Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Contracts](contracts.md)
- [Connections](connections.md)
- [Implementation](implementation.md)
- [Verification](verification.md)

## Edition 1 specification

The [operation contracts](contracts.md) select schemas, defaults, transitions, failures and acceptance cases. Follow the [ordered implementation slices](implementation.md) and [verification specification](verification.md), with the [shared foundation](../architecture/contract-foundation.md), [storage schema](../architecture/storage-contract.md) and [build handoff](../engineering/build-handoff.md). Status is specified proposal; implementation and runtime verification remain NOT RUN.
