# F01 — Gateway and transport

Primary phase: IP02. Target: Specify authenticated routes, session scope and durable SSE replay; keep controllers thin.

Dependencies and consumers: [security](../security/index.md), [sessions](../sessions/index.md). These are responsibility links, not whole-feature build ordering; see the [roadmap](../engineering/roadmap.md).

## Edition 1 specification

The [operation contracts](contracts.md) select schemas, defaults, transitions, failures and acceptance cases. Follow the [ordered implementation slices](implementation.md) and [verification specification](verification.md), with the [shared foundation](../architecture/contract-foundation.md), [storage schema](../architecture/storage-contract.md) and [build handoff](../engineering/build-handoff.md). Status is specified proposal; implementation and runtime verification remain NOT RUN.
