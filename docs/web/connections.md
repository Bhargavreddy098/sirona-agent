# F23 cross-domain handoffs

F23 owns only interaction, local drafts and server-cache projection. window.sirona invokes the F01 registry under F22/F02 identity; each domain contract owns actual inputs/results. Gateway snapshot/events reconcile cache, F11 protects dirty-file conflicts, F08 owns approval descriptors and F15 supplies completion verdicts.

The exact request/result fields and transitions are owned by [contracts](contracts.md), with [shared envelopes/identity](../architecture/contract-foundation.md) and [F03 storage](../architecture/storage-contract.md). Resolve peer IDs through the [feature index](../INDEX.md); read that peer's contract before changing a handoff. No transport, UI, CLI or adapter may duplicate the business state machine.

On prerequisite failure return the owner's unavailable/blocked result before dispatch. On response loss use the original operation identity. Reconciliation, not repeated business mutation, resolves uncertain effects. Consumer rendering and notification failure never justify replaying a completed action.

Verify the [concrete acceptance cases](verification.md) and [worked cross-feature journey](../journeys/implementation-example.md) through the actual boundary; source helpers alone do not establish consumer integration. All application evidence remains NOT RUN.
