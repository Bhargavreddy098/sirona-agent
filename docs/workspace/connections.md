# F11 cross-domain handoffs

F22 supplies a one-time native root selection; F11 validates root/file handles, captures artifacts and computes previews. F08 binds the exact patch/Git descriptor; F09's effect coordinator persists intent/receipt through F03. F12/F16 exchange immutable artifacts through import/export ports, while F23 editor saves consume the same preview/apply contract.

The exact request/result fields and transitions are owned by [contracts](contracts.md), with [shared envelopes/identity](../architecture/contract-foundation.md) and [F03 storage](../architecture/storage-contract.md). Resolve peer IDs through the [feature index](../INDEX.md); read that peer's contract before changing a handoff. No transport, UI, CLI or adapter may duplicate the business state machine.

On prerequisite failure return the owner's unavailable/blocked result before dispatch. On response loss use the original operation identity. Reconciliation, not repeated business mutation, resolves uncertain effects. Consumer rendering and notification failure never justify replaying a completed action.

Verify the [concrete acceptance cases](verification.md) and [worked cross-feature journey](../journeys/implementation-example.md) through the actual boundary; source helpers alone do not establish consumer integration. All application evidence remains NOT RUN.
